I"M<p>I recently had the opportunity to represent AWS at the <a href="https://event.ciofutureit.com/futureit-dallas/">FutureIT2024 Dallas</a> conference held at AT&amp;T Stadium. This is a significant networking event in the Dallas metro area, attended by 200+ IT and security executives and professionals, including managers, directors, VPs, CIOs, and other industry leaders.</p>

<p>This year’s theme was <strong>Data, AI, and Digital Innovation: Preparing for Emerging Technologies in Business and Building Trust with Customers and Internally.</strong></p>

<p>During the event, I led an in-depth <strong>table discussion</strong>, along with my partners from Rackspace and MontyCloud, titled <strong>Overcoming Obstacles in Your Cloud Journey with AWS</strong>,</p>

<p>Additionally, I <strong>presented a session titled “Proactive Cloud Management: How to Fill in the Gaps.</strong> The session addressed common challenges customers face when scaling their cloud operations and highlighted how the AWS Cloud Optimization team helps resolve these challenges, using real-world examples.</p>

<p>The event was well-received, with positive feedback on the session, particularly for the practical examples discussed on creating Cloud Operations Centers at scale, such as those at Fidelity and Cox Automotive using the Well-Architected framework.</p>
