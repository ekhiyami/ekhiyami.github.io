  <li>
    <p>I led a cross-org team to create and launch the <a href="https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/108/aws-well-architected-foundations">AWS Well-Architected Foundation course</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This course is available for AWS customers, partners, and AWS field teams and provides a badge that can be validated through <a href="https://info.credly.com/">Credly</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The content was created based on the latest best practices from the Well-Architected Framework and included new topics like best practices on how to perform an AWS Well-Architected Framework review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The team included SMEs from Well-Architected SAs and SMEs from the AWS Training and Certifications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As of the time of writing, the course has been used to train about <strong>70k</strong> students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iâ€™m currently working on creating the intermediate version.</p>
