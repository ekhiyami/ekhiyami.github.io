<p>This is one of the most popular workshops and the first of its kind that combines two important topics: Migration and Well-Architected.</p>

<p>I had the idea of building a workshop right after joining the Well-Architected Team, coming from the Migration Specialists SAs team. This is what I like about moving teams: it broadens your perspective.</p>

<p>Between the time of giving this workshop at re:Invent 2022 and the time of writing this blog in mid-2024, this workshop has been downloaded and used about <strong>15,000 times</strong>. It has been used to train thousands of AWS SAs, AWS Partners, and AWS customers.</p>

<p>Because of its popularity, I expanded this workshop, along with a group of my friends and colleagues from AWS, to become a Migration Lens as an official extension to the AWS Well-Architected Framework.</p>
