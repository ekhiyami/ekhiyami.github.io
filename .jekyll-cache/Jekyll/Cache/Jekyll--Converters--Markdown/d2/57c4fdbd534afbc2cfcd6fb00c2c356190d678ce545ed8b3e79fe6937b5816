<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is WA-Gen-AI app. My second Gen-AI POC that I built this year after the success I had in building the first one, the <a href="https://ekhiyami.github.io/video-chat/">YouTube Summarizer</a>.</p>

<p>In this POC, I use Gen-AI to streamline the Well-Architected Review for an application written in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform, or else.</p>

<p>This solutions received a lot of attractrions from my collegues and from AWS customers. 
After I published I was reached out by an awesome group of SAs in my team who took it and improve it and went through the necessary reviews to make it an offical solutiosn on AWS Repo.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, <strong>Commonwealth Bank</strong>, an Australian multinational bank, used this solution to streamline their Well-Architected Reviews.</p>

<p>They were so impressed that they wanted to showcase it publicly on stage at <strong>re:Invent 2024</strong>, AWSâ€™s largest annual conference.</p>

<p><strong>Long Summary</strong></p>

<p>If youâ€™ve been an AWS customer for some time you should be familiar with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html">Well-Architected Framework</a> . Itâ€™s the ultimate collection of AWS best practices across 6 pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability).</p>

<p>and the <strong>Well-Architected Review</strong>  is the process to validate your architecture for these best practices. The results would be a list of identified risks (high, medium) in the architecture and action items to improve them.</p>

<p>The <strong>WA-Gen-AI App</strong> takes a CloudFormation template uploaded by the user, uses AWS Bedrock for Gen-AI and Streamlit for the front-end, and Python to interact with the AWS Well-Architected Tool, iterate through best practices, and complete the review.</p>

<hr />

<p>In my testing, I was able to complete the review in a few minutes, compared with a few hours that were traditionally needed by customers or the AWS team to bring everyone into the same room and answer the 57 of review questions manually.</p>

<p>In the 3-tier classic application I tested, the WA-Gen-AI app was able to answer about <strong>50%</strong> of the questions and save <strong>hours</strong> of manual review.</p>
