I"Á<p>I was recently recognized by mentoring platform <a href="https://topmate.io">TopMate.io</a> as being in the top 1% of mentors worldwide. As recognition, my photo and bio were displayed on a billboard in Times Square, NYC on August 29, 2025, for a few hours.</p>

<p>This recognition is based on multiple factors including my achievements in the industry, candidate feedback, and the impact Iâ€™ve made on the careers of the professionals Iâ€™ve helped.</p>

<p>This was a deeply emotional moment for me, especially because NYC is the same place where I arrived in America about 15 years ago, trying to figure things out. I remember how I was overwhelmed by the lights and noise of Broadway, but never imagined I would appear on one of the billboards one day.</p>
