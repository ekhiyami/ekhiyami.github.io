<h2 id="built-100-with-amazon-q-developer">Built 100% with Amazon Q Developer</h2>

<p>I used Amazon Q Developer to re-build my personal website site and added more features to it.</p>

<p><strong>What Amazon Q Developer Built:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete Jekyll website with GitHub Pages deployment</li>
  <li>Professional design system with Tailwind CSS</li>
  <li>Responsive layouts for all pages (Home, About, Publications, Mentoring)</li>
  <li>Publications table with categorized content</li>
  <li>Mentoring service integration with topmate</li>
  <li>Consistent navigation and user experience</li>
  <li>Mobile-optimized responsive design</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Process:</strong>
Started with a basic Jekyll template and iteratively built each component through AI-assisted development. Amazon Q Developer handled everything from design decisions to code implementation to deployment configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Jekyll, Tailwind CSS, GitHub Pages, Lucide Icons, AOS animations.</p>

<p>This demonstrates the power of AI-assisted web development - creating professional, production-ready websites entirely through conversational programming.</p>
