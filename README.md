***

I entered the software business in 2000 when I got accepted into the School of Computer Engineering. During the 5-year program, I started working as a **freelance technical support specialist**, visiting customers at their homes or workplaces to fix their computers or printers. I then began **teaching IT courses**.

***

By the time I graduated from engineering school, I had built enough confidence to land my first corporate role as a **network and system administrator**.

Since then, I have held multiple roles: **technician, software developer, tech support, salesperson, system administrator, network administrator, database administrator, architect, manager, project manager, entrepreneur, and solution architect**. I am also a **husband, father, mentor**, and **hobbyist visual creator**.

***

Currently, I am employed at **Amazon Web Services**, where I support multiple teams. My business title is Solutions Architect. Iâ€™m an SME in **Cloud Optimization, Migration and Modernization, Resiliency**, and a few other areas. I enjoy building things that solve customers' problems and evangelizing them. Breaking down complex problems into manageable solutions and then documenting and sharing them comes naturally to me.

I've been an architect in customer-facing roles for the past 10 years. I like to think of my role as a **customer advisor**, a transformer, a bridge between complex and sometimes messy technical terms and customers. I help customers understand technology and navigate it to transform their business in plain language. I do this through **speaking, writing, coding**, and occasionally **illustrating**.


*** 

This website serves as a platform for me to share the things I build. Over time, the list of projects has grown quite long and doesn't fit well on my LinkedIn profile page. Unless otherwise stated, all artifacts shared here are owned by my employer and represent their opinions.

I work only on things that I enjoy. If I'm working on something I like, I may steal a few hours from weekends, nights, or bedtime to make progress. Given that context, I'm not a typical 9-5 person, but also not a geek.
