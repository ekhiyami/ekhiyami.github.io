This is my 3-part blog post series to explain in detail the steps and best practices to conduct a Well-Architected Review. The purpose of the WA review is to identify architecture risks and create a treatment plan to remediate them.

This blog series is one of the most popular articles I have published because it’s original. There was no such blog post that talked about the WA review in detail before. At the time of writing, it had 200k+ views.

The series was traslated to multiple langauges.
