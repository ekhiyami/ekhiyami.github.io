* I led a cross-org team to create and launch the [AWS Well-Architected Foundation course](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/108/aws-well-architected-foundations).

* This course is available for AWS customers, partners, and AWS field teams and provides a badge that can be validated through [Credly](https://info.credly.com/).

* The content was created based on the latest best practices from the Well-Architected Framework and included new topics like best practices on how to perform an AWS Well-Architected Framework review.

* The team included SMEs from Well-Architected SAs and SMEs from the AWS Training and Certifications.

* As of the time of writing, the course has been used to train about **70k** students.

* I'm are currently working on creating the intermediate version.
