title:  "The AWS MAP Automation "

**[Deliverables: Automation, AWS Service, Documentation, Internal Enablement]**

* I contributed to the original **technical specifications** of the popular **AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP)** as a migration SA specialist. 

* I then **created the MAP Automator**, which automates the manual on-boarding part for MAP customers. This expedited the on-boarding process by **70%**. 

* In a second iteration, and based on my customers' feedback, **I led a cross-org change in the technical requirements** and created another automation that **completely streamlined the on-boarding** process and made it even faster.

* The automation I created is still part of the current MAP documentation and, since its release, has been used by **5k+** customers.

* This automation streamlined the migrations for many customers and created the foundation for the automation that was later used by my colleagues at AWS to expand further and integrate with other AWS services (e.g., AWS Application Migration Service).

* In 2022, I personally unlocked 100 migration opportunities using this approach, which earned me the title of Champion across all AWS with the most opportunities unlocked.
