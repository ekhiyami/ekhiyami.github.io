**[Deliverable: YouTube Summarizer, blog post, more].**

As part of learning Gen AI, I built an app that 'summarizes YouTube videos and makes them conversational'.

The whole process from starting building the code to writing a blog post about it took about 6 hours. The app was received with celebration by the community and many VPs at AWS because it shows how efficiently you can be to build quick products that solve real problems using AWS Gen AI Stack.

To date, the app has been used by more than ***100k** users. Wow, beyond my expectation. Maybe I should build a commercial version?

- My blog post on how I built and a demo it is on the [AWS Community Blog](https://community.aws/content/2hPtf0UuIXSLqJk5MKolbOoA7Qv/how-i-built-a-video-chatter-app-with-almost-zero-code?lang=en).

- My LinkedIn [Post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eb-khiyami/recent-activity/all/) about the story with references.
