I recently had the opportunity to represent AWS at the [FutureIT2024 Dallas](https://event.ciofutureit.com/futureit-dallas/) conference held at AT&T Stadium. This is a significant networking event in the Dallas metro area, attended by 200+ IT and security executives and professionals, including managers, directors, VPs, CIOs, and other industry leaders.


This year's theme was **Data, AI, and Digital Innovation: Preparing for Emerging Technologies in Business and Building Trust with Customers and Internally.**

During the event, I led an in-depth **table discussion**, along with my partners from Rackspace and MontyCloud, titled **Overcoming Obstacles in Your Cloud Journey with AWS**,

Additionally, I **presented a session titled "Proactive Cloud Management: How to Fill in the Gaps.** The session addressed common challenges customers face when scaling their cloud operations and highlighted how the AWS Cloud Optimization team helps resolve these challenges, using real-world examples.

The event was well-received, with positive feedback on the session, particularly for the practical examples discussed on creating Cloud Operations Centers at scale, such as those at Fidelity and Cox Automotive using the Well-Architected framework.
