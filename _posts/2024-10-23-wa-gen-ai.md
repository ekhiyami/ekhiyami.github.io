This is WA-Gen-AI app.My second Gen-AI POC that I built this year after the success I had in building the first one, the [YouTube Summarizer](https://ekhiyami.github.io/video-chat/).

In this POC, I use Gen-AI to expedite and complete a Well-Architected Review for an application written in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform, or else. 


If you’ve been an AWS customer for some time you should be familiar with the [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) . It’s the ultimate collection of AWS best practices across 6 pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability).

and the **Well-Architected Review**  is the process to validate your architecture for these best practices. The results would be a list of identified risks (high, medium) in the architecture and action items to improve them.

The **WA-Gen-AI App** takes a CloudFormation template uploaded by the user, uses AWS Bedrock for Gen-AI and Streamlit for the front-end, and Python to interact with the AWS Well-Architected Tool, iterate through best practices, and complete the review.

In my testing, I was able to complete the review in a few minutes, compared with a few hours that were traditionally needed by customers or the AWS team to bring everyone into the same room and answer the 57 of review questions manually. 

In the 3-tier classic application I tested, the WA-Gen-AI app was able to answer about **50%** of the questions and save **hours** of manual review.

### What's next

There are many potentials for customers to adopt this solution and benefit from it. Currently, this solution is hosted on my own repo, but I'm working to make it an official solution hosted on the AWS official repo. Will update here as we make progress.
