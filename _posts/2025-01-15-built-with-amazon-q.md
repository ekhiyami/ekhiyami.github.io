## Built 100% with Amazon Q Developer

I used Amazon Q Developer to re-build my personal website site and added more features to it. 


**What Amazon Q Developer Built:**
- Complete Jekyll website with GitHub Pages deployment
- Professional design system with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive layouts for all pages (Home, About, Publications, Mentoring)
- Publications table with categorized content
- Mentoring service integration with topmate
- Consistent navigation and user experience
- Mobile-optimized responsive design

**The Process:**
Started with a basic Jekyll template and iteratively built each component through AI-assisted development. Amazon Q Developer handled everything from design decisions to code implementation to deployment configuration.

**Technologies Used:** Jekyll, Tailwind CSS, GitHub Pages, Lucide Icons, AOS animations.

This demonstrates the power of AI-assisted web development - creating professional, production-ready websites entirely through conversational programming.
