I decided to test [AWS Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) and Amazon Q Developer to re-build my website, this website. This is to show the capabilities of both tools. I was surprised (and mind blown) at the same time with the ease and simplicity of this process.

I'm not a web developer, but I was still able to live code the entire process that started with taking a basic Jekyll template and keep adding pages, visual components, and other functions to it until I was satisfied with its design. I then connected Kiro with my GitHub account and asked it to publish it to GitHub Pages. 

## Tech Stack
- Jekyll 4.2.0
- GitHub Pages
- Sass
- Amazon Q CLI
- WebP image optimization
- Git for version control

## Result 
The whole process of migrating from my old github basic  Jekyll template to this one, with better graphic, optimization, and added more functions (for example, my mentoring service), took a few hours. When I finished building everything in my local environment, I asked Q to deploy to production. I did the whole thing. It had some deployment issues initially due to Ruby compatibilities issues with Github Pages, but eventually, it figured out it. 

The result is what you see here. A nice website running in production. Let me know what you think.
