I was recently recognized by mentoring platform [TopMate.io](https://topmate.io/ekhiyami) as being in the top 1% of mentors worldwide. As recognition, my photo and bio were displayed on a billboard in Times Square, NYC on August 29, 2025, for a few hours.

This recognition is based on multiple factors including my achievements in the industry, candidate feedback, and the impact I've made on the careers of the professionals I've helped.

This was a deeply emotional moment for me, especially because NYC is the same place where I arrived in America about 15 years ago, trying to figure things out. I remember how I was overwhelmed by the lights and noise of Broadway, but never imagined I would appear on one of the billboards one day.
