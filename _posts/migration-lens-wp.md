The [AWS Migration Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/migration-lens/migration-lens.html ) is a comprehensive compilation of migration best practices that extends the six pillars, the design principles, and the best practices of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The idea of the Migration Lens came after I delivered a session at re:Invent 2022 called [Migrate to AWS the Well-Architected Way], a workshop that focused on migration best practices. Many customers asked us to expand this session into a more scalable and prescriptive format. We listened and we delivered.

I developed this whitepaper by working with a team of 50+ SMEs from multiple teams across AWS. We had experts from all the AWS Well-Architected pillars and migration teams. After a lot of debates, a lot of writing, studying, and many, many hours of reviews, feedback rounds, etc.. we came up with the final product that you can see here:

[Here is my announcement on LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7155987327771701249//)


I was impressed by the attention the Migration Lens received from our customers. I received tons of feedback from customers and fellow Amazonians.

Currently, I'm working on a few projects to improve and scale the adoption of the Migration Lens in a way that benefits customers more systematically...stay tuned.
