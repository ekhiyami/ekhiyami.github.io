<p># Chat with Your AWS Bill Using Amazon Q CLI</p>

<p>In this blog post, I‚Äôll walk you through a simple demo to chat with your AWS bill‚Äîbreak it down, analyze it, and get cost optimization recommendations based on the AWS Well-Architected best practices. This uses the latest <strong>MCP support</strong> recently added to the <strong>Amazon Q CLI</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-what-can-you-ask">üí¨ What can you ask?</h2>

<p>With this setup, you can ask Amazon Q natural language questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is my storage cost across all regions?</li>
  <li>What is my total spend in the last month?</li>
  <li>Based on my S3 usage, can you recommend ways to reduce costs?</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶and much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Amazon Q will understand your question using one MCP server, then route it to another server that can fetch and calculate the data. In some cases, it may even generate and run scripts on your behalf to get the answer. For example, if you ask for the <strong>total cost of EBS storage across all regions</strong>, it may need to gather and compute data that‚Äôs not directly available from the Cost Explorer API.</p>

</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Watch the demo</a></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The architecture is a standard MCP server architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="-the-setup-is-simple">üß± The setup is simple</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-set-up-amazon-q-cli">Step 1: Set up Amazon Q CLI</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Install the Amazon Q CLI</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q login</code></li>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is my latest publication. After publishing the <a href="https://ekhiyami.github.io/wa-course/">Well-Architected Foundation digital course</a> last year and making it available for AWS customers and partners, I received feedback that the course is basic and doesn‚Äôt go into the details and advanced options. So, I took the lead on creating an advanced version of it. We called it <strong>Well-Architected for Enterprises</strong>. As the name implies, it‚Äôs designed to teach our customers how to do scale adoption of best practices for 100s of applications and show them what tools, programs, solutions available for them to do so.</p>

<p>The course took about <strong>6 months</strong> to complete, including planning, assembling a team of SMEs and reviewers, creating the content, and developing knowledge checks. At the time of writing this post, the course has received <strong>positive feedback</strong> and has been taken by about <strong>5k individuals</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is WA-Gen-AI app. My second Gen-AI POC that I built this year after the success I had in building the first one, the <a href="https://ekhiyami.github.io/video-chat/">YouTube Summarizer</a>.</p>

<p>In this POC, I use Gen-AI to streamline the Well-Architected Review for an application written in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform, or else.</p>

<p>This solutions received a lot of attractrions from my collegues and from AWS customers. 
After I published I was reached out by an awesome group of SAs in my team who took it and improve it and went through the necessary reviews to make it an offical solutiosn on AWS Repo.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/wagenai-2.png" alt="wa-gen-ai" /></p>

<p>In recent weeks, <strong>Commonwealth Bank</strong>, an Australian multinational bank, used this solution to streamline their Well-Architected Reviews.</p>

<p>They were so impressed that they wanted to showcase it publicly on stage at <strong>re:Invent 2024</strong>, AWS‚Äôs largest annual conference.</p>

<p><strong>Long Summary</strong></p>

<p>If you‚Äôve been an AWS customer for some time you should be familiar with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html">Well-Architected Framework</a> . It‚Äôs the ultimate collection of AWS best practices across 6 pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability).</p>

<p>and the <strong>Well-Architected Review</strong>  is the process to validate your architecture for these best practices. The results would be a list of identified risks (high, medium) in the architecture and action items to improve them.</p>

<p>The <strong>WA-Gen-AI App</strong> takes a CloudFormation template uploaded by the user, uses AWS Bedrock for Gen-AI and Streamlit for the front-end, and Python to interact with the AWS Well-Architected Tool, iterate through best practices, and complete the review.</p>

<hr />

<p>In my testing, I was able to complete the review in a few minutes, compared with a few hours that were traditionally needed by customers or the AWS team to bring everyone into the same room and answer the 57 of review questions manually.</p>

<p>In the 3-tier classic application I tested, the WA-Gen-AI app was able to answer about <strong>50%</strong> of the questions and save <strong>hours</strong> of manual review.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I built a solution to set up Disaster Recovery sites on AWS for Azure and GCP customers. After being used successfully by multiple customers and translated into multiple languages as blog posts, the solution became part of the official AWS Disaster Recovery Service (AWS DRS).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="here-is-the-full-story">Here is the full story</h3>

<p>Last year, I took on a new challenge to expand my technical impact by joining the Resilience Technical Field Community (TFC) at AWS as a Disaster Recovery SME. This role complemented my work on the Well-Architected team, where I engaged with several customers whose main workloads were on Azure or GCP. These customers wanted to leverage AWS Disaster Recovery Service (AWS DRS) to build a disaster recovery solution on AWS.</p>

<p>During my interactions, I discovered a significant gap in the AWS Disaster Recovery Service (AWS DRS) failback process (from AWS to GCP/Azure). The failback client provided by AWS DRS was not directly compatible with booting on Azure/GCP VMs. Many customers had to manually build a custom image on EC2 with the failback client before creating a compatible VM on the respective cloud.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>In a DR solution, there are two main steps: <strong>failover</strong>, which is to fail from a primary site to your backup site in case of a disaster, and <strong>failback</strong>, which is the opposite operation, to fail back from the backup site to the main site after the disaster situation is cleared.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>To address this issue, I developed a solution to automate the steps needed to build an Azure/GCP-compatible VM with AWS DRS, ready to boot from. I collaborated with the head of product at AWS DRS to get my solution approved and published it on <strong><a href="https://github.com/aws-samples">AWS Samples</a></strong> (an official AWS repo for sample solutions approved by AWS, ready for customers to use). This solution included automation scripts that both Azure and GCP customers could use to streamline the failback process while building their DR on AWS.</p>

<p>To help the community, I also wrote a series of blog posts titled <strong>Building a Disaster Recovery Site on AWS for Multi-cloud Workloads</strong> providing a step-by-step implementation guide. Since releasing these solutions, they have helped numerous customers unblock their DR projects on AWS. It also assisted the <strong>AWS Support</strong> team in resolving multiple SIMs and contributed to progressing <strong>SFDC opportunities</strong>, generating significant <strong>ARR</strong>. The blog posts have been <strong>recognized</strong> by my colleagues at AWS for their improtance and were <strong>translated</strong> to Spanish and Japanees.</p>

I built a solution to set up Disaster Recovery sites on AWS for Azure and GCP customers. After being used successfully by multiple customers and translated into multiple languages as blog posts, the solution became part of the official AWS Disaster Recovery Service (AWS DRS). Here is the full story Last year, I took on a new challenge to expand my technical impact by joining the Resilience Technical Field Community (TFC) at AWS as a Disaster Recovery SME. This role complemented my work on the Well-Architected team, where I engaged with several customers whose main workloads were on Azure or GCP. These customers wanted to leverage AWS Disaster Recovery Service (AWS DRS) to build a disaster recovery solution on AWS. During my interactions, I discovered a significant gap in the AWS Disaster Recovery Service (AWS DRS) failback process (from AWS to GCP/Azure). The failback client provided by AWS DRS was not directly compatible with booting on Azure/GCP VMs. Many customers had to manually build a custom image on EC2 with the failback client before creating a compatible VM on the respective cloud.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Top 20 Blog Posts I Authored for AWS</title><link href="/blogs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Top 20 Blog Posts I Authored for AWS" /><published>2024-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/blogs</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blogs/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an example of the blog posts I published on the official AWS Blog around topics of my specialty: Migration, Well-Architected, and Disaster Recovery.

<p><img src="/assets/migration-lens0.png" alt="wa-migration" /></p>

<p>This is one of the important projects I created, led, and delivered.</p>

<p>Here is the story of the Migration Lens.</p>

<p>At AWS, there is something called TFC (Technical Field Community) that consists of experts in different domains. For example, there are Migration TFCs, Networking TFC, AI TFC, etc.</p>

<p>In 2023, I was part of the leadership team of the Migration and Modernization TFC. As I was digging into some data to find out the most needed or frequently encountered issues by customers, I found that a significant percentage of the requests coming to the TFC were about questions related to implementing specific best practices in migration projects.</p>

<p>Most of the questions could be categorized under this category:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How do I make sure my migration project follows AWS best practices?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seemed like an opportunity to fill this gap, especially because there was no comprehensive content available online covering end-to-end migration projects, from securing executive sponsorship to discovery to building the landing zone on AWS, to migrating and then modernizing applications on AWS.</p>

<p>In Amazon fashion, to start a project, you need to write a two-pager and go through several iterations with leaders and stakeholders to secure sponsorship. In a few weeks, I secured leadership support across multiple teams and was given the OK to build the team to create what we call the Migration Lens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Migration Lens is a collection of best practices that extend the original, well-known Well-Architected Framework but specifically addresses best practices across the three phases of migration (assess, mobilize, migrate) and intersects them with the six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework. So, there were 18 areas to address</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I built and led a team of about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/migration-lens/contributors.html">30 SMEs</a> across all areas, and we started defining the structure of how the content should look. It took us about 10 months to build it and clear all the review requirements and bar-raising from different experts.</p>
