title: My Gen-AI Video Summarizer that Went Viral
---

As part of learning Gen AI, I built an app that **summarizes YouTube videos and makes them conversational**.

> You can try it [here](https://video-chat.streamlit.app/).

The whole process, from starting building the code to writing a blog post about it, took about 6 hours. The app was received with celebration by many VPs at AWS because it shows how efficiently you can build a quick product that solves real problems using the AWS Gen AI Stack.

To date (July 7 2024), the app has been used by more than **100k** users. Wow, beyond my expectations. Maybe I should build a commercial version?
