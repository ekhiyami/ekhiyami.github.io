title: My Gen-AI Video Chat App that Went Viral
---

As part of learning Gen AI, I built an app that **summarizes YouTube videos and makes them conversational**.

* You can try it [here](https://video-chat.streamlit.app/).

The whole process, from starting building the code to writing a blog post about it, took about 6 hours. The app was received with celebration by many VPs at AWS because it shows how efficiently you can build a quick product that solves real problems using the AWS Gen AI Stack.

To date, the app has been used by more than 100k users. Wow, beyond my expectations. Maybe I should build a commercial version?

My blog post on how I built it on the AWS community blog can be found [here](https://community.aws/content/2hPtf0UuIXSLqJk5MKolbOoA7Qv/how-i-built-a-video-chatter-app-with-almost-zero-code?lang=en).
